## packages/telescope

A TypeScript CLI and Node.js library that launches real browsers, collects performance data, and saves results locally.

**Supported browsers:** Chrome, Chrome Beta, Chrome Canary, Edge, Firefox, Safari (WebKit)

**What it collects per test:**

- HAR file (`pageload.har`)
- Web Vitals and performance metrics (`metrics.json`)
- Console output (`console.json`)
- Resource timing data (`resources.json`)
- Screenshot (`screenshot.png`)
- Filmstrip and video of the page load

### Quick start

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build -w packages/telescope
npx . -u https://example.com -b chrome
```

Or from `packages/telescope/` directly:

```bash
cd packages/telescope
npm install
npm run build
npx . -u https://example.com -b chrome
```

Or install from npm and use the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @cloudflare/telescope
telescope -u https://example.com -b chrome
```

See [`packages/telescope/README.md`](./packages/telescope/README.md) for full documentation.

## packages/telescope-web

The Astro + Cloudflare Workers web application hosted at [telescopetest.io](https://telescopetest.io). Users upload Telescope ZIP results and view an interactive breakdown of metrics, waterfall, filmstrip, console logs, and more.

**Stack:** Astro v6, Cloudflare Workers, D1 (SQLite via Prisma), R2, Workers AI

### Quick start

```bash
cd packages/telescope-web
npm install
npm run dev:setup  # one-time setup: DB, migrations, Prisma client, type generation
npm run dev
```

```

## CI

- **`test.yml`** — runs on every push and PR (excluding `packages/telescope-web/**` changes). Builds `packages/telescope` and runs the full browser test suite inside the official Playwright Docker container.
- **`deploy.yml`** — runs on push to `main` when `packages/telescope-web/**` changes. Applies D1 migrations, builds, and deploys to Cloudflare Workers.
