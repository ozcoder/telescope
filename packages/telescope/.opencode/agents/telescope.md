## Project Maintenance

### GitHub PRs in-progress

This section covers the process for checking PRs in-progress.

When user requests to check PRs in-progress with `check prs` command,
check if there are any PRs that had changes or comments since the last PR review.

Consider comments that I reacted to using an emoji as addressed by me and ignore them.

#### Required Action after listing the PRs

After you show PR summary, always run `open https://github.com/cloudflare/telescope/pull/$PR_NUMBER` to open the links to the PRs that need my attention in my browser; the user will need to manually approve this `open` command when prompted.
