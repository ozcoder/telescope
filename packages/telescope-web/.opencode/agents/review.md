READ ONLY - NO EDITS

CHECK FOR:

**Code Structure:**

- Scoped <style> per component
- Server-side render first (flag unnecessary client scripts)
- Named exports only (flag default exports except Astro pages/components)
- type for read/data models, interface for Props
- Client utilities in src/lib/<feature>/ (no inline redeclaration in script blocks)

**Database:**

- Explicit Prisma select (never findMany({}))
- Null/undefined handling for D1 fields
- Dates as Int (Unix seconds) not DateTime
- All DB access via testRepository.ts
- Prisma client from context.locals.prisma

**API & Security:**

- Zod validation on API inputs
- API responses: { success, error? } with proper status
- No user input in R2 keys without sanitization (use security.ts helpers)
- No raw Prisma errors exposed
- No secrets logged
- File validation for uploads (whitelist expected Telescope files)
- XSS prevention in user-generated content

**Performance:**

- Promise.all instead of await loops
- loading="lazy" on images
- Astro v6 optimizations enabled

**Compliance:**

- NEVER add any comments or allow any commits with internal Cloudflare links or data
- AI content rating handling for SAFE/UNSAFE content
